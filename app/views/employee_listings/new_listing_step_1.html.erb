        As a job seeker, you can list yourself and your
        listing will be seen by hundreds of potential
        employers.<br />
        <br />
        As a company, sharing employees is a great way to
        reduce your biggest overhead costs - wages. Your
        employee also gets better job security, gains experience, connects with more people.<br />
