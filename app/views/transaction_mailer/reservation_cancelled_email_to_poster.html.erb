        <br />
        We regret to inform you that your Hirer - <%= @hirer.name %> cancelled 
        hiring 
        for <%= @listing.name %> from <%= @transaction.start_date.strftime("%d-%b-%Y") %> to <%= @transaction.end_date.strftime("%d-%b-%Y") %>. Per your cancellation 
    policy, your payout
    has been updated to $0.00 AUD. The Hirer was refunded.<br />
        <br />
    This payout will be released 24 hours after the contract start date. You can 
    review the
    updated payout in your Transaction History.<br />
        <br />
    Your calendar has also been updated to show that the previously booked 
    dates are
    now available.<br />
        <br />
    Regards,<br />
    The Spare Staff Team<br />
        <br />
    P.S. We know getting a cancellation is disappointing. But hirings 
    rarely get
    cancelled, so don’t worry, this isn’t likely to happen
    often!</td>
