  <div><b>For your consideration</b></div>
  <br/>
  <div>It's best practice to give employees warnings in writing before ending their employment.</div>
  <br/>
  <div>An employer doesn't have to give an employee 3 warnings, or even 1 warning but an employer should give the employee a chance to fix any performance issues. If you still want to terminate the employment contract, consider giving the employee the right Notice of termination to avoid unfair dismissal claim later.</div>
